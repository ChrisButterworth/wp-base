# WordPress Project Base

An easy way to spin up new WP projects with composer and wpackagist.

## Getting started

To get started you can run `composer create-project chrisbutterworth/wp-base wp-base` to set up the scaffold and install its dependencies.

Next rename or duplicate `.env.example` to `.env` and edit to include your details.

Go forth and code!

### Notes

By default all plugins and themese are in the `.gitignore` file but can be overwritten within it to include custom plugins and themes.

Works with wp-cli too
